An SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) is basically a hybrid between a developer and a tester — someone who not only verifies software quality but also builds the tools, frameworks, and automation needed to do that efficiently.

Here’s the breakdown:

Role of an SDET in IT

Primary Goal: Ensure high-quality software delivery by combining coding skills with strong testing expertise.

Mindset: Think like a developer (write maintainable, efficient code) and a tester (anticipate where bugs hide).

Scope: Works across functional testing, automation, API testing, performance, and sometimes even DevOps integration.

What an SDET Does

Test Automation Development

Design and build automation frameworks (UI, API, mobile, database).

Write and maintain automated test scripts in languages like Java, Python, C#, or JavaScript.

Integrate automation into CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps).

API & Backend Validation

Use tools like Rest Assured, Postman, or custom scripts to test REST/SOAP APIs.

Verify data integrity by querying databases (SQL/NoSQL).

Performance & Scalability Testing

Use tools like JMeter, Gatling to test system performance under load.

Test Strategy & Planning

Work with developers and product teams to define test coverage, edge cases, and acceptance criteria early in the SDLC.

Shift-Left Testing

Participate in code reviews, suggest testability improvements, and write unit/integration tests alongside developers.

Defect Prevention & Debugging

Investigate failures, analyze logs, and even debug application code to find the root cause.

Tool & Process Improvement

Create custom utilities for data setup, mock services, or report generation.

Optimize existing test frameworks to reduce execution time.
