Getting socket timeout exception while doing a soap call
ChatGPT said:
A Socket Timeout Exception during a SOAP call usually indicates that the client is waiting too long for a response from the server. Here are some possible causes and solutions:

1. Increase Timeout Settings
If you're using Spring Boot with RestTemplate, you can configure timeouts:

HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory factory = new HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory();
factory.setConnectTimeout(5000); // 5 seconds
factory.setReadTimeout(10000);  // 10 seconds
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate(factory);
If using Apache HttpClient, set timeouts like this:

RequestConfig config = RequestConfig.custom()
    .setConnectTimeout(5000)
    .setSocketTimeout(10000)
    .build();
CloseableHttpClient client = HttpClients.custom()
    .setDefaultRequestConfig(config)
    .build();
2. Verify Server Response Time
Check if the SOAP service is slow or unreachable.
Try making the request using Postman or SoapUI and see if it works.
3. Firewall & Network Issues
Ensure no firewall is blocking the request.
Try using telnet to test connectivity:
telnet <SOAP_SERVER_HOST> <PORT>
If it fails, check network rules.
4. Proxy Settings
If you're behind a proxy, set the proxy configuration:

SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory requestFactory = new SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory();
Proxy proxy = new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP, new InetSocketAddress("proxy.example.com", 8080));
requestFactory.setProxy(proxy);
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate(requestFactory);
5. Check the Server Logs
Look at server logs for delays or failures.
If server processing is slow, try optimizing the backend.
6. Retry Mechanism
If timeouts are intermittent, implement retries with Spring Retry:

@Retryable(value = SocketTimeoutException.class, maxAttempts = 3, backoff = @Backoff(delay = 2000))
public Response callSoapService() {
    // SOAP call logic
}
7. Use a SOAP Client with Timeout Configuration
If using Spring Web Services, set the timeout:

WebServiceTemplate webServiceTemplate = new WebServiceTemplate();
((HttpUrlConnectionMessageSender) webServiceTemplate.getMessageSender()).setReadTimeout(10000);
Let me know how you're making the SOAP call, and I can give more specific advice!

How to set timeout in soap ui
ChatGPT said:
In SOAP UI, you can set the timeout for a SOAP request to avoid long waits for a response. Here’s how:

1. Set Timeout for a Request
Open SOAP UI.
Select your SOAP request.
In the Request Editor, look for the "Timeout" field at the bottom.
Enter the desired timeout in milliseconds (e.g., 5000 for 5 seconds).
Save and re-run the request.
2. Set Timeout Globally
If you want to apply a timeout to all requests:

Go to File → Preferences.
Select the HTTP Settings tab.
Locate "Socket Timeout (ms)".
Set a timeout value (e.g., 10000 for 10 seconds).
Click OK and restart SOAP UI if necessary.
3. Adjust Timeout in a Test Case (TestSuite)
If you're running SOAP calls inside a test case:

Open your Test Step (SOAP request).
Click on the "TestStep Properties" tab.
Set the Socket Timeout property to your desired value.
This ensures your SOAP requests don’t hang indefinitely if the server is slow. Let me know if you need more details!
