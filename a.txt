i am getting different scores in python and java

That‚Äôs a really good question üëç.
It‚Äôs **very common** to see different scores between **Python (e.g., scikit-learn + sklearn2pmml)** and **Java (JPMML Evaluator)**.
This usually isn‚Äôt because the PMML is wrong ‚Äî it‚Äôs because of **differences in preprocessing, data type handling, or default configurations**.

## üîé Common Reasons for Score Differences (Python vs Java PMML)

1. **Input Data Preprocessing**

   * If you used `StandardScaler`, `OneHotEncoder`, `MinMaxScaler`, etc. in Python, make sure those preprocessing steps are exported into the PMML file.
   * If preprocessing is missing in PMML, Python is scaling/encoding but Java isn‚Äôt.

2. **Categorical Encoding**

   * Python may treat `"Male"` and `"male"` differently, or trim spaces.
   * JPMML is **case-sensitive** and strict about matching category values.

3. **Data Types**

   * In Python, `int` vs `float` may not matter much.
   * In PMML/Java, passing `35` instead of `35.0` can cause subtle differences.
   * Always pass values as the correct **field type** (numeric, categorical, string).

4. **Default Values / Missing Values**

   * Python model might handle `NaN` in a custom way.
   * JPMML uses **missing value treatment** defined in PMML (eg. `"asMean"`, `"asMode"`).
   * If not defined, Java may output different results.

5. **Different Library Versions**

   * If you exported with `sklearn2pmml` (or Nyoka) from Python, check compatibility with the **JPMML version**. Sometimes schema differences cause evaluation mismatches.

## ‚úÖ Debugging Strategy

1. **Check Input Alignment**

   * Print the exact input features you pass in **Python** and compare them with what you send to **Java**.
   * Even a single `float vs int` or category case mismatch can change predictions.

2. **Inspect PMML**

   * Open the PMML file in a text editor and look for:

     * `<MiningSchema>` ‚Üí required fields
     * `<DataDictionary>` ‚Üí data types
     * `<TransformationDictionary>` ‚Üí preprocessing rules

   Make sure everything from Python preprocessing is present.

3. **Evaluate Same Data in Both**

   * Take **one record**, log the **exact values** in Python before scoring, then feed those into JPMML Java.
   * Compare intermediate outputs if possible (e.g., probabilities).

4. **Force Consistent Types in Java**

   ```java
   arguments.put(new FieldName("age"), Double.valueOf(35));  // not int
   arguments.put(new FieldName("income"), Double.valueOf(50000));
   arguments.put(new FieldName("gender"), "male");
   ```

## üîß Next Step

If you share:

* A sample **Python score** (input + output),
* The corresponding **Java score** for the same input,

‚Ä¶I can help you pinpoint *exactly* where the mismatch is (preprocessing, type handling, or category encoding).

üëâ Do you want to paste me **one sample record** with Python vs Java output so I can trace the difference?
